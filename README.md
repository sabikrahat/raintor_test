# Task 3: Technical Maturity

## 1. Architecture Summary

### State Management Choice: Riverpod

Riverpod was selected as the state management solution due to its robustness and scalability. It offers type safety, compile-time validation, and a declarative approach that is well-suited for both small and large applications. Unlike traditional approaches, Riverpod does not depend on widget context, making it easier to manage and test state logic in isolation. Its built-in support for asynchronous operations, such as handling API calls, further streamlines data fetching and UI updates.

### Code Structure for Scalability and Testability

The project follows a simplified MVC-style modular architecture. Feature-specific directories contain subfolders for models, providers, services, views, and controllers. This structure separates the responsibilities of data modeling, business logic, UI rendering, and external communication, ensuring that each layer is independently testable and maintainable. It also enables clean scalability by allowing new features or modules to be added without affecting existing ones.

### Production Readiness Improvements

For production readiness, the following improvements would be made:

- Complete polish of the user interface and experience, including animations, empty states, and accessibility enhancements.
- Centralized error handling for API failures, SignalR issues, and UI events.
- Consistent loader management across asynchronous screens or actions.
- Caching and offline support mechanisms for better performance and resilience.
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing of providers, services, and user flows.
- Enhanced logging and diagnostic reporting to monitor and trace runtime behavior.

## 2. SignalR Error Handling

### Disconnection Handling

Disconnections from the SignalR hub are handled gracefully by detecting when the connection is closed and resetting the connection state. This ensures the user is aware of the connection status and prevents broken UI behavior.

### Reconnection Logic

A retry mechanism is implemented using exponential backoff, which attempts to reconnect a limited number of times without blocking the user interface. This improves robustness during temporary network outages or backend interruptions.

### Unexpected Data or Format Issues

Data received from SignalR events is validated for structure and completeness before use. Any malformed or unexpected data is gracefully discarded or logged without breaking the application flow. This prevents crashes caused by bad data and improves the appâ€™s reliability in real-time communication scenarios.
